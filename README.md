# Practice branching int Git
  Create a new branch named bugfixBranch to simulate the process of fixing bugs <br>
git checkout -b bugfixBranch  <br>
  Commit and push the changes to the newly created branch <br>
  Open a pull request to merge with the master branch <br>
  
  Add a README.md file in the remote repository and pull the changes to the remote one <br>
git pull <br>

  Additional commands for branching: <br>
git checkout -b branchName (create and switch to a branch locally) <br>
git checkout anotherBranch (switching branch) <br>

git push -u origin branchName (push the branch to the remote 'origin' and set it as the upstream branch) <br>
git push origin branchName (specifically update the remote branch) <br>
